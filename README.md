Here i deploy the app using steamlit platform. In this app there is a map with embbeded different stakes
so firstly we create imaginary boundaries for different stakes and then copy the embedded link for that map and paste it in the code
After that we run the code and download the app file from collab notebook then upload that file to github
after that we connect steamlit with Github and deploy that app
Here is the link for that app
